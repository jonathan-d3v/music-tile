something i made for school
this is for an hpl task (you'd probably know it if you were in a british school) to create an app. yes thats it. nothing else. check it out. i hope you like it :)
this is an unbuilded version but i cant upload that because github doesnt let me upload more than 100 files and my build (onefile mode compiling is weird ok) cant be uploaded.
